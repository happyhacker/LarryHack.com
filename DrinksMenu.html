<h2>Mixed Drinks</h2>

<h3>Boulvevardier</h3>
<img src="images/Boulvevardier.png" width="300" height="200" alt=""/><br>
<p>The <a href="https://punchdrink.com/news/meet-the-negronis-dark-sexy-cousin-the-boulevardier/"> boulevardier</a> is a drink composed of whiskey, sweet vermouth, and Campari, garnished with an orange peel. 
  Its creation is ascribed to Erskine Gwynne, an American-born writer who founded a monthly magazine 
  in Paris called Boulevardier, which appeared from 1927 to 1932.
  The boulevardier is similar to a Negroni, sharing two of its three ingredients. 
  It is differentiated by its use of bourbon whiskey or rye whiskey as its principal component instead of gin.</p>

<h3>Grasshopper</h3>
<p><img src="images/Grasshopper.png" width="300" height="200" alt=""/><br>
  The Grasshopper is a green blast from the past featuring green creme de menthe, white creme de cacao and heavy cream. The drink was allegedly created in 1919 in New Orleans, but it didn’t become a household name until the 1950s. The original recipe results in a cocktail that looks like melted mint-chocolate-chip ice cream and kind of tastes like it, too.</p>

<h3>Manhattan</h3>

The Manhattan was the most famous cocktail in the world shortly after it was invented in New York City&rsquo;s Manhattan Club, some time around 1880. The Manhattan&rsquo;s mix of American whiskey and Italian vermouth, enlivened with a few dashes of aromatic bitters, is timeless and tasty.<br>

<h3><br>Mint Julep</h3>
<p><img src="images/MintJulep.png" width="300" height="200" alt=""/><br>
The Mint Julep is a bourbon cocktail best known for being the signature drink of the <a href="https://www.liquor.com/slideshows/kentucky-derby-cocktails/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kentucky Derby</a>.

<h3>Moscow Mule</h3>

<h3>Margarita</h3>
<p><img src="images/Margarita.png" width="300" height="200" alt=""/></p>
The Margarita is one of the most popular cocktails in North America. Combining the tang of lime and the sweetness of orange liqueur with the distinctive strength of tequila. Some say the cocktail was invented in 1948 in Acapulco, Mexico, when a Dallas socialite combined blanco tequila with Cointreau and lime juice for her guests. Order it straight up, on the rocks, or frozen.

<h3>Old Fashioned</h3>
<p><img src="images/OldFashioned.png" width="300" height="200" alt=""/></p>
<p>The old fashioned is a cocktail made by muddling sugar with bitters and water, adding whiskey or rye, 
  and garnishing with orange slice or zest and a cocktail cherry. It is traditionally served in an 
  old fashioned glass (also known as rocks glass), which predated the cocktail. Developed during the 19th 
  century and given its name in the 1880s, it is an <a href="https://iba-world.com/">IBA</a> Official Cocktail. </p>
<h3>Pink Lady</h3>
<p><img src="images/PinkLady.JPG" width="300" height="200" alt=""/><br>
The pink lady is a classic cocktail with a light blush of color that's not as sweet as modern pink martinis. This was one of the first "girly drinks" and a favorite among high-society ladies from the 1930s through the 1950s.
Made with Gin, Apple Brandy, Grenadine, lemon juice and egg white. Don't let the egg white deter you; it's just for a nice frothy texture, which greatly enhances the drink.
